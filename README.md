# Artificial Intelligence and Data Science

# ODD Semester

## Timetable Designed for Semester 7 By Me
- I planned to revise Machine Learning , Data Science , CPP , Python and SQL in the morning .
- Also I did Internship during Semester in Software Testing to dive deep into it .
- I covered Operating System and Computer Networking on Saturday and Sunday . 

## Regular Routine
